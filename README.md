# Irvine Gasoline Carbon Management App (SDC Hackathon)

## Overview
Irvine Gasoline, a large-scale oil and gas company, has realized the detrimental impact of their carbon dioxide emissions on the environment. In an effort to mitigate their carbon footprint, they have enlisted the help of our software solutions company to develop an application aimed at managing and achieving carbon neutrality. This application is designed to assist Irvine Gasoline in tracking historical emissions, calculating net carbon emissions, predicting future emissions, and planning the purchase of carbon offsets.

## Goals
- **Display Historical Data:** Visualize historical carbon emissions data to track trends and patterns.
- **Calculate and Display Historical Net Carbon Emissions:** Compute and showcase the net carbon emissions over time.
- **Predict and Communicate Future Net Carbon Emissions:** Utilize predictive models to estimate and communicate future carbon emissions.
- **Plan the Purchase of Future Carbon Offsets:** Assist in planning the purchase of carbon offsets to neutralize emissions.

## Implementation Details
- **Backend:** Implemented using Flask Python to handle server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **Frontend:** Developed with React to create an interactive user interface.
- **Features:** The frontend includes a line graph for comparing emissions and offsets across different sectors.

## How We Did It
We utilized Flask Python for the backend to manage API endpoints and React for the frontend to create an interactive user interface. The backend includes routes for various endpoints, providing relevant JSON data to the frontend. The frontend features a line graph that visually represents the difference between emissions and offsets across different sectors.
